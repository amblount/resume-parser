We believe every engineer brings something unique to the team and seek to bring out the best in every individual. </span></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><span>This role is based in our headquarters in NYC. <br><br></span></p>\n\n<p><span>Sound interesting?

        "contents": "<p><strong>About Us</strong></p>\n\n<p><span>At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers trillions of requests per month. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare have all web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was recognized by the World Economic Forum as a Technology Pioneer and named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!  </span></p>\n\n<h4>About the department</h4>\n\n<p>Cloudflare’s Engineering Team builds and runs the software that handles requests on the Internet today. We also build and run the internal tools that builds and runs our software. The Engineering Team is split into two groups: one handles product development and the other handles operations. Product development covers both new features and functionality and scaling our existing software to meet the challenges of a massively growing customer base. The operations team handles one of the world’s largest networks with data centers in 102 cities worldwide.</p>\n\n<h4>What you'll do</h4>\n\n<p>We are looking for experienced front-end engineers to join our team. The ideal candidates will have experience working with <span>large-scale applications</span> and a track record of producing great output. You must care deeply not only about the quality of your and the team's code, but also the customer experience. We have growing front-end needs, so we’re looking for highly motivated individuals that are excited to join a team and work with product and content owners, designers, and other software engineers to build and scale services at Cloudflare.</p>\n\n<p>We believe that a great design is at the heart of any successful product and you will work closely with our design/UX team and must be comfortable seeking feedback from non-technical sources. We work iteratively and deploy often (sometimes several times per day). We are also strong believers in dog-fooding our own products. From cache configuration to Cloudflare Access to Cloudflare Workers, these are all tools in our frontend engineer's tool belt. </p>\n\n<p>Technologies we use include Node, React, Redux, TypeScript, ES6, Webpack, Fela, Jest, Enzyme, Puppeteer, D3, and more.</p>\n\n<p>We have many teams that build and maintain user interfaces. Our San Francisco teams include:</p>\n\n<h4>Load Balancing</h4>\n\n<p>This team owns our load balancing product end-to-end—from the core functionality at our edge, to internal systems and pipelines, to the configuration and reporting UI available in our customer dashboard.</p>\n\n<h4>Billing</h4>\n\n<p>Building and maintaining the systems and interfaces that define our product offering, the control mechanisms for giving customers access to those products, and the overall purchase experience.</p>\n\n<h4>Security Engineering</h4>\n\n<p>Has ownership of our TLS offerings (Universal SSL, Dedicated Certificates, etc), the series of pipelines that drive certificate ordering, issuance, and deployments to our edge, along with the customer UIs to manage it all.</p>\n\n<h4>User &amp; Account Security/Management</h4>\n\n<p>This team owns the foundational data models that power the Cloudflare dashboard, which involves building and maintaining solutions for both our end-user and engineers on other teams. Whether it's building granular access control policies or different user authentication methods, the impact is far reaching.</p>\n\n<h4>Data &amp; Analytics</h4>\n\n<p>Owns the core analytics product offered by Cloudflare (and all of the underlying data pipelines). This mission is to expose valuable data and actionable insights to our customers.</p>\n\n<h4>Marketing Engineering</h4>\n\n<p>Builds and maintains <a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/\">www.cloudflare.com</a> powered by a headless CMS to<span> host the content. We then deliver the content and have built support for automated translation of the content</span>. Also builds microsites as requested for special projects.</p>\n\n<h4>UI Platform</h4>\n\n<p>Responsible for building, documenting, and supporting the underlying tools, systems, and patterns that enables Cloudflare engineers to make UIs. Both developer and customer experience are driving forces.</p>\n\n<h4>Desirable Skills and Experience</h4>\n\n<p>Note: it is not required that you have all of these! Teams have varying needs, focuses, and use varying technologies.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>BA/BS in Computer Science or equivalent</li>\n<li>Minimum of 2+ years experience building web applications</li>\n<li>Strong knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>\n<li>Understanding of responsive design and its implementation</li>\n<li>Experience building and shipping production React.js applications</li>\n<li>Extensive knowledge of the JavaScript ecosystem</li>\n<li>Ability to work in cross-functional teams</li>\n<li>Good analytical and debugging skills</li>\n<li>Unit/integration testing experience</li>\n<li>Experience working with and/or designing RESTful APIs</li>\n<li>Working knowledge of internationalization, localization, and/or accessibility</li>\n<li>Expertise with TypeScript</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What Makes Cloudflare Special?</strong></p>\n\n<p><span>We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.</span></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/protecting-free-expression-online/\"><strong>Project Galileo</strong></a><span>: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.</span></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/athenian/\"><strong>Project Athenian</strong></a><span>: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.</span></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/path-forward/\"><strong>Path Forward Partnership</strong></a><span>: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.</span></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://1.1.1.1/\"><strong>1.1.1.1</strong></a><span>: We released</span><a href=\"https://1.1.1.1/\"> <span>1.1.1.1</span></a><span> to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our</span><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/commitment-to-privacy/privacy-policy/privacy-policy/\"> <span>privacy policy</span></a><span> and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Sound like something you’d like to be a part of? We’d love to hear from you!</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Cloudflare is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.  We are committed to providing equal employment opportunity for all people and place great value in both diversity and inclusiveness.  All qualified applicants will be considered for employment without regard to their, or any other person's, perceived or actual</span> <span>race, color, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, age, physical or mental disability, medical condition, family care status, or any other basis protected by law. </span><span>We are an AA/Veterans/Disabled Employer.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Cloudflare provides reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities.  Please tell us if you require a reasonable accommodation to apply for a job.

A world where every door is unlocked and every host treats you like family. Where every city is a village and every block a community. In this world, we can become anything we want. This is the magical world of Airbnb!</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>About Airbnb:</strong></p>\n\n<p><span>Founded in 2008, Airbnb is a global travel community that offers magical end-to-end trips, including where you stay, what you do and the people you meet.

At the core of trust is safety, and thus we spend a significant amount of our time and energy keeping the community safe. The Trust team is responsible for protecting our community and platform from fraud while also ensuring our hosts, guests, homes, and experiences meet our high standards.

As an Alto Engineer, you will have the opportunity to build across the breadth of our products -- from our patient mobile application to our provider web dashboard to internal tools for our home grown pharmacy management system called Wunderbar. Our mission at Alto is to fulfill medicine’s true purpose—to improve quality of life—for everyone who needs it. We are building the best pharmacy for everybody, everywhere.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>You are a generalist who owns projects from end-to-end, enjoys problem-solving, and values the impact your work makes on our patients. You always put the patient experience first. You are scrappy and resourceful, unafraid to dive into an unknown project but humble enough to make mistakes and iterate. You thrive on speed and wearing many hats, and you enjoy working on different parts of the tech stack (we use Ruby on Rails, React, React Native, and Go).</span></p>\n\n<p><span><strong>Within your 1st month</strong>, you will ship small features to Alto’s products. You’ll familiarize yourself with our tech stack, code review process, and codebase to learn how everything connects together. You’ll also shadow our Pharmacy Operations, Patient Care, and Fulfillment Teams to understand Alto from every perspective, and you’ll even speak to real patients on a support call. By your 2nd month,  you will contribute to the planning, scoping, and code of a larger project. By your 3rd month, you’ll possess the confidence and skill set to own and ship a large project or feature. You’ll feel comfortable within our codebase and be able to tackle bugs independently.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Example Projects of an Alto Engineer:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fertility Auto-Billing</strong>:<span> The process of billing for fertility medication is very complex. To automate the manual work of calculating medication costs for the patients, we began by solving structural problems within our complex systems like understanding which clinics should be eligible for certain coupons and differentiating how much we saved patients vs how much their insurance contributed. Once we solved for these challenges, we automated the billing process with Ruby, React, and Postgres. This simplified an end-to-end billing process from how we receive prescriptions for fertility patients to generating competitive medication quotes for them.</span><span><br></span></li>\n<li><span><strong>React Native Patient App</strong>: Building a patient mobile app from scratch in React Native for both iOS and Android, along with the API endpoints to integrate the app with Alto’s backend. This app enables patients to onboard, schedule deliveries, order refills, communicate with their pharmacist, and better understand their medications.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><strong>Bottoms Up Analytics: </strong><span>To put our patients first, we often analyze how to increase the efficiency of our own internal workflows. One of our projects called Bottoms Up Analytics provides real time tracking metrics on where our Patient Care and Pharmacy Teams are spending their time daily in Wunderbar. We do that by using a Javascript client that reports the activity to our microservices; it is designed for high throughput and receives hundreds of requests/sec. Having this insight allows our engineers to prioritize and implement new projects and features that enable other teams cross-functionally to work more efficiently while providing the best patient care possible.</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>You are an ideal candidate if you:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><span>Are familiar or excited to learn/code with several programming languages and web frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Javascript, React, React Native, Go, or Python.</span></li>\n<li><span>Thrive in a dynamic fast-paced environment where you own products from start to finish, and make decisions quickly and independently. You may break things, but you fix them with speed.</span></li>\n<li><span>Have 4+ years of experience writing production code.</span></li>\n<li><span>Believe in Alto’s mission and embodies our </span><a href=\"https://alto.com/careers\"><span>company values </span></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Want more insight into what motivates us to save patient lives?

Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers trillions of requests per month. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare have all web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was recognized by the World Economic Forum as a Technology Pioneer and named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare.

This platform supports over 16 millions websites and Internet applications handling a huge percentage of global HTTP requests, and supports the 1.1.1.1 public DNS resolver and other services.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Our network is an extension of our customers’ networks as their services flow over our network. This makes working at Cloudflare particularly exciting as it’s not just about keeping our service online, secure and performant, but our customers as well.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>You may be a good fit for our team if:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><span>You have successfully led a large, follow-the-sun SRE or operations team for a SaaS/online product</span></li>\n<li><span>You have seen and understood the challenges in a global, distributed, always-on application that is continually evolving</span></li>\n<li><span>You have strong mentoring, recruiting and leadership ability at the director level or above (i.e. someone who has managed managers)</span></li>\n<li><span>You are a creative problem-solver: while experience counts a lot, it’s the ability to solve new and interesting problems in a dynamic environment that will ultimately be most important.</span></li>\n<li><span>You are a leader that can shape the structure and processes that will make the team successful and happy. We want people to be able to grow within the team.</span></li>\n<li><span>You want to own end-to-end availability and performance to prevent problem recurrence</span></li>\n<li><span>You want to implement a world-class continuous improvement process that includes root-cause analysis, solution identification and implementation, and ongoing emphasis on auto-remediation</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>This role will report to the CTO and your peers will be the Head of Engineering and the Head of Research.
