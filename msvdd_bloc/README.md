## msvdd_bloc

Put source code (outside of notebooks) for use in this project here! This includes scripts and general-purpose utils, and maybe even proper "lib" code if we get there.

Note: If you want to use any of the code in here from within a notebook in the `notebooks` directory, you'll have to add this directory to your `PYTHONPATH`. See the top-level readme for getting started instructions.
