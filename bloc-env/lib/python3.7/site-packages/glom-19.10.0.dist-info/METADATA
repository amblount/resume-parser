*glom gets results.*

To be more precise, glom helps pull together objects from other
objects in a declarative, dynamic, and downright simple way.

Built with services, APIs, and general serialization in mind, glom
helps filter objects as well as perform deep fetches which would be
tedious to perform in a procedural manner.

Where "schema" and other libraries focus on validation and parsing
less-structured data into Python objects, glom goes the other
direction, producing more-readily serializable data from valid
higher-level objects.
